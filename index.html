    <h2> Who am I? <h2>
    <p> <font color="white" font face="cambria" font size="4"> I'm a 17 year old student that is heading to the Univeristy of Waterloo in the fall, for the Honours Computer Science and Business Administration program! I have a keen interest in Computer Science, Mathematics and Business and hope to work for Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple or Facebook someday! After my undergraduate degree I also aspire to get my Masters in Business Administration. I created this website after taking a course on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn"><font color="white"> Code Academy</font></a> which really helped me out alot, so if you are new to programming I really encourage you to check it out!</font> </p>

			<h3>Goals </h3>
			<p><font face="cambria"></font>While learning Computer Science independantly, I wish to develop critical think and excellent problem solving skills. Before heading to university in the fall, I would like to learn basic web development as well as familiarize myself with Java and Scheme programming. These days I am also reading a book about Scheme program called "How to Design Programs" which I have also linked below.</font></p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p><font face="cambria">I am originally from Pakistan and attended John Fraser Secondary School. Though I originally planned on studying Electrical Engineering, I later decided to go into Computer Science and Business at the University of Waterloo. I will be moving to Kitchener, Waterloo in the fall for my first year at the University of Waterloo.</font></p>

			<h3>Side Projects</h3>
			<p>I am very new to the world of Computer Science and programming, so I do not have an impressive list of side projects and apps. However I am more than willing to learn and have started looking into app development and various programming languages. Linked above is a link to my new GitHub account which I picked up recently. Feel free to follow me and watch my progress!</font></p>
